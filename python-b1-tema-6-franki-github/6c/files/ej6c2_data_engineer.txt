What is a data engineer and why is it relevant in the world?

Data engineering is a discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of
systems and solutions for managing and processing large amounts of data. Data engineers are
responsible for developing scalable and robust infrastructures for data management, as well as
implementing data pipelines that allow for the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of
information from various sources.

In the information age, data has become one of the most valuable assets for companies and organizations
around the world. The ability to process and analyze large volumes of data in real-time is essential for
informed decision-making and for creating new products and services. Data engineers are crucial in this
process as they are responsible for ensuring that information is available, reliable, and ready for use.
